# **Features**

**1. Flavor Management**

Add new flavors with detailed descriptions, seasonal labels, and pricing.   
   View all available flavors or filter by seasonal options.
   Search for specific flavors using keywords.

**2. Ingredient Management**

Add and maintain ingredients with quantities and measurement units.
Keep track of ingredient availability for inventory purposes.

**3. Allergen Management**

Track and update allergen information for customer safety.
Prevent duplication with unique allergen records.

**4. Customer Cart Management**

Add or remove flavors to/from a shopping cart.
View cart contents with real-time price calculation.
Clear the cart when starting a new transaction.

**5. Database Integration**

Uses SQLite for persistent data storage.
Data is retained across sessions, ensuring reliability.

# **File Structure**

Defines data models for the system:
  Flavor, Ingredient, Allergen, and Cart.
Provides methods for cart operations like adding and removing items.

**2. database.py**

Implements database interactions using SQLite.
Handles CRUD operations for flavors, ingredients, and allergens.
Provides search capabilities for flavors.

**3. main.py**

Entry point for the application.
Implements a user-friendly command-line interface.
Integrates flavor, ingredient, allergen, and cart management.

# **Technologies Used**

Language: Python (3.8 or later)
Database: SQLite
Modules: Python's built-in libraries, including dataclasses and sqlite3
